//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q1 HERE]
    // No need for ? after words[0] and words[1] since it is already been made in the init function signiture

    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?

    //let is a constant and i needs to get updated so it needs to be a var.
    //We should return Bool without the ! just in case its a nil
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?

//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q3 HERE]
// dictionary was initialized wrong.
// Bool needs to have ! after it since we suppose to return only true or false.
// change nil to true

//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
